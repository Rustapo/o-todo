# o-todo

### Yet another note-taking app!?
Yes, but it's diffrent.  

### How is it diffrent?
First of all, you need to host this one on your own. Second, it's written from scratch in plain HTML, CSS JS and PHP. __No libraries, No dependencies!__  

### Why should i use this instead of <insert other note taking app here>?
By using some else's note taking app, you rely on their security and that they will keep their service online for as long as you need it. 

### Install
To host this, you need a web server (nginx, apache, whatever), PHP and MySQL. PHPMyAdmin makes your life way easier as well. Import the `o-todo.sql` and create a new db user. Make the `app` folder the web-root.

### Compatibility
This application uses ES6 and will not work in old/shitty browsers. (IE)
